            <div class="proj-title"><h3>Qless</h3></div>
                <p class="summary">Qless is my brainchild app that I began working on during the Spring of 2020. I was tired of getting to certain dining 
                    locations on campus and seeing a massive line out the door. What Qless is, is an app that shows users how busy a dining location is 
                    in real time. In order to solve this problem, I began brainstorimg with a couple of my friends and we have foucsed on possible pressure or heat sensors, or 
                    facial recogition cameras. Orginally meant for college students, we have talked about the possibility of branching out to different markets. As of May 25, 2020 
                    we are still finalizing a concrete solution before coding anything.

            <div class="proj-title"><h3>Identity Management</h3></div>
                <p class="summary">The Idenity Management Office at texas A&M is my current part-time student employment. I have been at this office for over 1one and a half years now. 
                    During this time, in addition to customer service and data collection and entry, I have had the opportunity to utilize my Python coding skills in 
                    real ptangaible projects that the office uses. My sophomore year I learned Slenium automation and coded a couple Python scripts using that technology in order 
                    to automate testing of some of our flagship websites. My current project, as of May 25 2020, is reviewing code to facilitaet the switch from Python 2 to Python 3 
                    in important datafeed scripts and also writting unittests for those datafeed scripts that contain information on all affiliates of Texas A&M University.

            <div class="proj-title"><h3>Personal Website</h3></div>
                <p class="summary">The website you are currently on was built in May 2020. Utilizing LinkedIn Learning and other resources, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS 
                    in order to build this website. I also utilized PHP to create the contact form seen in my "Contact Me" page. It was important for me to find productive outlets 
                    for my free time during quarantine. Plus, it was also a lot of fun designing my own website!
