        <h2>My Small Auto-Biography</h2>
        <p id="summary">
            Born in Venezuela, I spent my early childhood in Anaco where family members were never lacking. Around 2004-2005, my family moved away to the United States 
            for the first time. Here, I learned English and spent the next 8 years of my life. We lived in Oklahoma and later California. 2013 was an important year for me because it was the 
            year we moved away from the United States, the only home I could remember, to Kuwait, half a world away. Culture shock was inevitable, but the Middle East was where I gained lifelong friends
            and was able to discover what the rest of the world had to offer. I loved learning about new cultures and it was here, ironically, where I grew to love and embrace my own Latin and Hispanic identity. These years were the best years of my life. But, not surprisingly, we moved yet again in 2016 to Houston, Texas where I remained
            until coming to College Station to attend Texas A&M University. Initially a Mechanical Engineering major, it was in my introductory engineering course that I discovered a passion for programming and solving logical problems. 
            After that I didn't look back, and now I'm studying for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

                <h3>YouTube</h3>
                <p class="interest-desc">VRC_Programming is the Youtube channel I created in April 2020 while I finished up my classes for the semester at home. The premise 
                    of my channel is to show any one who is learning to code or is wanting to start what coding projects and assignments actually look like. In my videos, I detail the 
                    struggle that all programmers face when writting and debugging code. I show myself Googling and reading documentation to give viewers and realistic look 
                    at the day-to-day of solving a coding problem. Over time, I hope to build my channel and gain more interested viewers.

                <h3>Options Trading</h3>
                <p class="interest-desc">One of my life goals is to become finacially independent at a young age. I became obsessed with this idea aroung the age of 18 and looked for ways 
                    to grow finacially. Options trading is one of the means in which I want to become finacially independent. Using Robinhood and a relatively small amoun of capital, I trade
                    using strategies devised by Colobian econmist Alejandro Cardona. Right now, I only look to make a 5% gain in my total accoung per week as I am just starting out. Eventually, 
                    I do hope to gain confidence and trade more frequently and effectively.

                <h3>Keyboards</h3>
                <p class="interest-desc">The hobby of mechanical keyboards is something new to me. It started out as me just watching Youtube videos and maybe purchasing a cheap one to 
                    try out for the first time. But very quickly, I became a little bit obsessed with the hobby; specifically, all the different customizations that could be made to any one keyboard. 
                    My discord is full of keyboard enthusiast servers now. This is a very expensive hobby and I have only been able to get a couple inexpensive practice keybaords. I am currently constructing keyboards for my cousin and myself and will leave 
                    the picture below once they are done!
