          <h2 class="title">My Small Auto-Biography</h2>
          <p id="sum1">
            Born in Venezuela, I spent my early childhood in my hometown of Anaco. 
            Around 2004-2005, my family moved away to the United States, and in 2013 we eventually moved to Kuwait. Culture shock was inevitable, 
             but the Middle East was where I gained lifelong friends and was able to discover what the rest of the world 
             had to offer. I loved learning about new cultures and it was here, ironically, where I grew to love and 
             embrace my own Latin and Hispanic identity. <br>  </p>

             <p id="sum1">
           <br> I have experienced many different cultures and have worked with many 
             types of people, whether it be for school, work or after-school activities. I am driven by a love of knowledge and I'm always interested in learning about new technology, new research or new trends in the world on computer science.
              Any company I work for in the future will get my enthusiasm and drive to succeed each day!

          <h3>Cooking</h3>
          <p>I love watching cooking videos on youtube and recreating them at home. Once or twice a week I try to cook for my roommate and I.
              Recently, I made homemade meatball subs, authentic bolognese sauce with fresh pasta, and a seafood-style spaghetti dish. 
              In the future, I want to try to make homemade ramen and a philly cheese steak!

          <h3>Options Trading</h3>
          <p>One of my life goals is to become financially independent at a young age. 
              I became obsessed with this idea around the age of 18 and started looking for ways to grow financially. 
              I soon began to learn about options trading. Using Robinhood and a relatively small amount of capital, I
               trade using strategies devised by Colombian economist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTLuaaS6VwSrb5xdFm2mLyw" target="_blank">Alejandro Cardona</a>. Right now, I look to make a 5% gain of my total account per week. 
              Eventually, I do hope to gain confidence and trade more frequently and effectively.

          <h3>Anime</h3>
          <p>Over the 2020 winter break I got really into anime thanks to my cousin. Before this, I had only partially watched The Naruto Series. Now, I can say anime is one of my 
              favorite genres to watch. Some of the ones I am watching currently are Attack on Titan and The Promised Neverland. Other good ones I've watched are Erased and Neon Genesis
              Evangelion. Even though I've watched several anime series at this point, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Narutopedia" target="_blank">Naruto</a> will forever be my favorite anime just for the nostalgia factor.
